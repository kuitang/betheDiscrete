function [ gams,sumN,prodN,thisN ] = fdm(theta, W, A, B, epsilon, method, L, U)
%[ gams,sumN,prodN,thisN ] = fdm(theta, W, A, B, epsilon, method, L, U)
% First derivative mesh revised by AW.
% gams has all the mesh points
% sumN=total no. mesh points across all dims, prodN=\prod_i N_i
% thisN has N_i for each dimension
% methods: simple, minsum, adaptivesimple, adaptiveminsum (see SODA paper)

%   calculates the first-derivative mesh
%   to accuracy epsilon. gams is a N-vector of step sizes, one in each
%   variable. A, B, L, U are N-vectors of bounds; L and U come from BBP.
%   If not provided, they're calculated here based on the A, B vectors of
%   bounds provided.
%   Define \gamma as the *width* of the mesh (so that, e.g.
%   q_{i,n+1} = q_{i,n} + \gamma_i). (This is at variance with notes2,
%   where \gamma is the distance to the nearest mesh point. So this
%   function will sometimes use 2*\gamma).
%
%   This means first mesh point is at Ai+gamma_i/2 then keep
%   adding gamma_i to get the next point, until we reach >= Bi
%
%   method can be simple, lagrangian, adaptive. If adaptive, gams will be a
%   length-N cell array, and will contain an array of grid points instead
%   of just step sizes.
%
%   Calculate the maximum first derivative in each direction. The bound
%   is
%
%   -\theta_i - W_i + \log U_i + \log \frac{q_i}{1 - q_i}
%   \leq \frac{\partial F}{\partial q_i}
%   \leq -\theta_i + V_i - \log L_i + \log \frac{q_i}{1 - q_i}
%
%   To bound, we consider the maximum modulus of the bound on either side.
%   This amounts to checking the lower-left and upper-right corners.
%
%   Later we extend     - integrate rather than sum max
%                       - factor in direction, so e.g. if start from left
%                       Ai, the first mesh point should cover all possible
%                       global min q^ to the left, so only need use
%                       integral of upper bound of derivative (and can
%                       ignore the lower bound function). Then we compute
%                       the 'reach to the right' of the first mesh point,
%                       where for this we must use the lower bound
%                       derivative, which is used for the upper bound of
%                       the - derivative.  From there, again we use the
%                       upper bound only to compute the next mesh point,
%                       which must reach back to the left to the previous
%                       reach point, and continue...
%
%   Note the integral of \log \frac{q}{1 - q} is
%       q \log q + (1-q) \log (1-q) + const
%
%   We can raise the lower bound curve by \log U_i and lower the upper
%   bound curve by \log L_i.

% since we assume something at least as good as BBP has already been run to
% completion to produce the A and B which were input.
