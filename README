TODO: The first derivative mesh is not yet implemented in C++.
If that is done, the whole interface can live inside C. As of now, bound propagation and mesh computation are computed in MATLAB.
So long as N is not too huge, this should work fine.

TODO: DOCUMENT *twoMargs, meshSize, misc and other structures!

// This could be the final (clean) release code.
